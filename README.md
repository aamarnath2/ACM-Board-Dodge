# ACM-Board-Dodge

10/29/16 - 10/30/16

A simple GUI game in which a user must dodge several obstacles, represented by the ACM Board members. The program uses the Java Swing toolkit and incorporates event listeners, timers, and JFrames.

This game was created by myself, Sandeep Suresh, Alina Abidi, and Brad Yang during Trojan Hacks, a hackathon held by USC ACM.
